# Vector Space Modeling with NumPy & Pandas
Explore core vector space concepts—dot products, cosine similarity, orthogonality—using Python’s data science stack. This project blends NumPy's linear algebra power with Pandas' data handling to build intuitive, modular tools for recommendation systems, search ranking, and performance analytics.

## Features
-Modular functions for vector operations

-Cosine similarity and dot product demos

-Real-world datasets (anime ratings, EPL stats, etc.)

-Beginner-friendly documentation and visualizations

-Reusable components for dashboards and analytics

### Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vector-space-numpy-pandas.git
cd vector-space-numpy-pandas
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Usage
Run any notebook in the notebooks/ folder or import modules from src/ to integrate into your own projects.
from src.vector_ops import cosine_similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)

##### Demo Ideas
-Anime recommendation engine using cosine similarity

-EPL team performance clustering with vector embeddings

-Finance ticker comparison via vector angles
